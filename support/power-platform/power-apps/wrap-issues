# Troubleshooting ribbon issues in Power Apps

## Build is failing in wrap

### Verify your images are in PNG format 

Ensure that the images you are uploading in warp are in PNG format. Note that manually chnaging your image extnsion from JPEG or other to .PNG does not automatically re-format your images
into the PNG format. Use an image converter tool or ensure your original image is a real PNG instead. 


### Verify your App Center is correctly configured 

Ensure your App Center link is created as an App within an Org, and not a standalone App.
