# Troubleshooting wrap issues in Power Apps

This guide helps you resolve issues that affect build in wrap in Power App.

### Verify your images are in a PNG format 

Ensure you have not manually renamed the file extension of an image, e.g. JPEG, and mark it as a .png, as that will fail the build. Use an image converter or ensure your original image is a real PNG instead.
