# AI Builder trial license still displays in the top banner after you've purchased an AI Builder license

This article provides an explanation about the AI Builder trial license that still displays in the top banner after that you have purchased an AI Builder license.

_Applies to:_ AI Builder


## Symptom

I've purchased a Power Apps license as a user but in the app it still says trial.

## Cause

If you've purchased a premium Power Apps license, you got a small number of AI Builder credits.

## Resolution

The trial message will disappear at the end of your trial period, and you'll use your seeded credits instead.
