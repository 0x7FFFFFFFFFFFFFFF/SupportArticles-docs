# AI Builder trial License that is still displayed in the top banner after that you have purchased an AI Builder License

This article provides an explanation about the AI Builder trial License that is still displayed in the top banner after that you have purchased an AI Builder License.

_Applies to:_ AI Builder


## Symtom

I have purchased a power apps license as a user but in the app it still says trial

## Cause

If you have purchased a premium Power Apps license, you got a small amount of AI Builder credits.

## Resolution

The trial message will disapear at the end of your trial period and you will use your seeded credits instead.
