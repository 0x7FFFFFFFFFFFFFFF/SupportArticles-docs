    - Microsoft Edge (version 80 or later)
    - Google Chrome

2. Check that you've enabled the UI flows for Power Automate chromium extension:

    - In Microsoft Edge, navigate to [edge://extensions](edge://extensions)
    - In Google Chrome, navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

    Verify that the extension is enabled in the extensions page:

    Enable the extension by toggling the switch on the card.

3. Verify that the UI flows service is running

    There should be an icon in the system tray:

    If the icon isn't present, you can manually start the service by searching for **UI flows** in the **start** menu:

    - In Windows 8.1 or earlier, navigate to **Control Panel** → **Add or Remove Programs**

    Look for the UI flows installation package:
