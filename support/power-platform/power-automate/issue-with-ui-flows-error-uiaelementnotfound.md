## Verifying issue

This error occurs if your UI flows has the property **Use coordinates** set to **true** and UI flows is unable to locate the element using coordinates and the display resolution and scale on your playback machine does not match the scale and resolution of the machine on which the UI flows was recorded. The issue can be verified by following these steps:

- Select and expand the Launch \<Application Name> step in your UI flow.
- Select the **Show more** link.

## Solving steps

2. Keep the app maximized while recording to get an optimum performance.
