# Sharing a desktop flow with connections to other co-owners

Desktop flows containing connections used by cloud connectors can be shared as every other desktop flow.

For the time being though, such a flow, if modified by multiple owners, may result in erroneous behavior.

## Example:

- Co-Owner A creates a desktop flow that utilizes SharePoint connector actions (thus a working SharePoint connection they own).
- Co-Owner A shares the desktop flow with Co-Owner B.
- Co-Owner B tries to execute the desktop flow and receives an error since they do not have access to the SharePoint connection in it.
- Co-Owner B modifies the SharePoint action to use a connection they own and saves the flow.
- Co-Owner B can now execute the flow successfully but Co-Owner A is now receiving an error since  they do not own the SharePoint connection in use.
 

Even if connections are left unchanged, if Co-Owner B saves the flow, if for example they add a desktop flow action, the flow will be saved with an erroneous state, resulting in failed execution for and every Co-Owner of the said desktop flow.

 

## Proposed approach:

If you wish to provide co-owner access during sharing to desktop flows, It is suggested to create copies of those flows, dedicated to the co-owners that will be working on them.
