# I received the error “Please restart the computer and run setup again”

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptom
When attempting to install Visual Studio you receive the following error “The computer needs to be restarted before setup can continue. Please restart the computer and run setup again.”

## Resolution
In most cases, you just need to restart the computer to get past this error. There are times, however, when you might get this error again even though you’ve already restarted the computer. This can happen when the installation of a program or Windows update needs to make additional changes and those changes also require that the computer be restarted. If you see this error after you restart your computer, try restarting it again.

If you’ve restarted the computer more than two or three times, and you’re still seeing this error, try and reinstall any programs or Windows updates you’ve installed recently. This might allow a failed installation to complete successfully.
