# Troubleshooting: Why can I not see all available templates?

 _Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio for Mac

In the New Project Dialog, you only see the templates of components that have been installed. If you're missing any following templates, make sure the correct components are installed:

| Missing Template | Component to Install |
|---|---|
| Android | Android |
| iOS | iOS |
| tvOS | iOS |
| watchOS | iOS |
| Multiplatform | Android and iOS |
| Mac | macOS (Cocoa) |
| .NET Core | .NET Core |

Run the `VisualStudioForMacInstaller.dmg` again to install the components. If you no longer have it, you can download it from the [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) webpage.
