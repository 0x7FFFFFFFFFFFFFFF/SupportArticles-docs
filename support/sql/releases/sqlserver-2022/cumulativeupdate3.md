### Analysis Services CU build version

Beginning in Microsoft SQL Server 2017, the Analysis Services build version number and SQL Server Database Engine build version number don't match. For more information, see [Verify Analysis Services cumulative update build version](/sql/analysis-services/instances/analysis-services-component-version).

### Cumulative updates (CU)

- Each new CU contains all the fixes that were included with the previous CU for the installed version of SQL Server.
- SQL Server CUs are certified to the same levels as service packs, and should be installed at the same level of confidence.
- We recommend ongoing, proactive installation of CUs as they become available according to these guidelines:
  - Historical data shows that a significant number of support cases involve an issue that has already been addressed in a released CU.
  - CUs may contain added value over and above hotfixes. This includes supportability, manageability, and reliability updates.
- We recommend that you test SQL Server CUs before you deploy them to production environments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hybrid environment deployment</b></summary>

When you deploy an update to a hybrid environment (such as Always On, replication, cluster, and mirroring), we recommend that you refer to the following articles before you deploy the update:

- [Upgrade a failover cluster instance](/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/upgrade-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-instance)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't want to use the rolling update process, follow these steps to apply an update:
    >
    > - Install the update on the passive node.
    > - Install the update on the active node (requires a service restart).

- [Upgrade and update of availability group servers that use minimal downtime and data loss](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn178483.aspx)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enabled Always On together with the **SSISDB** catalog, see the [information about SSIS with Always On](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-integration-services/ssis-with-alwayson/ba-p/388091) about how to apply an update in these environments.

<details>
<summary><b>Language support</b></summary>

SQL Server CUs are currently multilingual. Therefore, this CU package isn't specific to one language. It applies to all supported languages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Components (features) updated</b></summary>

One CU package includes all available updates for all SQL Server 2022 components (features). However, the cumulative update package updates only those components that are currently installed on the SQL Server instance that you select to be serviced. If a SQL Server feature (for example, Analysis Services) is added to the instance after this CU is applied, you must reapply this CU to update the new feature to this CU.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Support for this update</b></summary>

If additional issues occur, or if any troubleshooting is required, you might have to create a service request. The usual support costs will apply to additional support questions and to issues that don't qualify for this specific cumulative update package. For a complete list of Microsoft Customer Service and Support telephone numbers, or to create a separate service request, go to the [Microsoft support website](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=support).
