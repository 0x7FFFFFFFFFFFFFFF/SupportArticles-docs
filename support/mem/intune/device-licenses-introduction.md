# Introduction to device licenses in Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune offers a device-only subscription service that helps organizations manage devices that aren't affiliated with specific users.

The Intune device subscription is licensed per device at a cost of $2 a month. For more information about the purpose of Intune device licensing, see [Microsoft Intune announces device-only subscription for shared resources](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Enterprise-Mobility-Security/Microsoft-Intune-announces-device-only-subscription-for-shared/ba-p/280817).

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Intune  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4514392

## How to purchase the device-only subscription

You can purchase device licenses based on your estimated usage. If the actual usage exceeds your current license limit, you don't have to purchase device licenses separately. You will be charged automatically when your devices are enrolled through any of the following methods:

- [Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying mode](/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/self-deploying)
- [Apple Device Enrollment Program without user affinity](/mem/intune/enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios)
- [Apple School Manager without user affinity](/mem/intune/enrollment/apple-school-manager-set-up-ios)
- [Apple Configurator without user affinity](/mem/intune/enrollment/apple-configurator-enroll-ios)
- [Android Enterprise dedicated](/mem/intune/enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll)
- [Using a device enrollment manager account](/mem/intune/enrollment/device-enrollment-manager-enroll)

All devices that are enrolled without user affinity will be assigned device licenses.

## Limitations

When a device is enrolled by using a device license, the following Intune functions aren't supported:

- [Intune app protection policies](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy)
- [Conditional access](/mem/intune/protect/conditional-access)
- User-based management features, such as email and calendaring.
