## Manage Intune and EMS subscriptions in the Office 365 portal

We have received feedback from you asking for fewer portals to manage your Microsoft subscriptions. Based upon this feedback, we are merging the Microsoft Intune account portal with the [Office 365 management portal](https://portal.office.com/?WT.mc_id=Blog_Intune_Announce_PCIT) to simplify your user experience.

As an initial change, the Office 365 management portal now supports subscription management and license assignment for Intune and Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS). Until late September, you can continue to use the Intune account portal while you update your workflows and bookmarks. Following this transition period, the Office 365 management portal will be where you will manage subscriptions and license assignments. We anticipate retiring the Intune portal on or after September 28, 2015 and an in-service banner will be added to remind you of this change.

For EMS customers who previously visited the Azure portal for user creation and license assignment, you can continue to use the Azure portal to take advantage of advanced features such as group license assignment. Alternatively, you can begin assigning licenses while already managing other subscriptions in the Office 365 management portal. There are no changes to the Azure portal or the Intune admin console as part of this migration.
