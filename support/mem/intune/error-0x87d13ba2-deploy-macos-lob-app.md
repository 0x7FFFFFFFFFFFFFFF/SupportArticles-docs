# Error 0x87D13BA2 when you deploy a macOS LOB app

This article gives a solution to the following error message when you deploy a macOS line-of-business (LOB) app in Microsoft Intune:

> One or more apps contain invalid bundleIDs. (0x87D13BA2)

## Symptoms

You publish a macOS LOB app using Intune. When you select the app in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), the **Device install status** shows the following information about the app:

- **Status**: Failed
- **Status details**: One or more apps contain invalid bundleIDs. (0x87D13BA2)

Here's an example of Microsoft Teams:

This problem can occur even if the app is successfully installed on the device.

## Cause

This problem occurs under the following conditions:

- Multiple applications are included in a macOS app package.
- The installation status of all individual applications that are included in the package arenâ€™t reported back to Intune.

Any app that has multiple components, such as Microsoft Teams, can generate this error message.

## Solution

Use the following steps to fix this problem and enable the macOS LOB app to correctly report its status.

1. On a macOS device that has the app installed through Intune, open Terminal and run the following command to output a list of installed apps to the current directory:

   ```console
   sudo /usr/libexec/mdmclient QueryInstalledApps > InstalledApps.txt
   ```

2. Open the InstalledApps.txt file in a text editor:

3. Go to the affected app in Intune > Properties > App information > Edit:

4.	Compare the list of included apps in Intune to the apps listed in the InstalledApps.txt, and remove any apps that are not showing in the text file:

5.	Review and save the application, and then sync the device to retrieve the latest app installation status:
