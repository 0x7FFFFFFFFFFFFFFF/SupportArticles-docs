# Known issues with Intune

This page lists recent known issues with Microsoft Intune. For a list of weekly feature announcements, see the [What's new in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/whats-new) in the Intune product documentation. Visit the [Intune Customer Success blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/bg-p/IntuneCustomerSuccess) for posts about best practices, support tips, and other tutorials, as well as a backlog of past known issues.

## Smart card removal behavior for Lock workstation has the wrong behavior applied on Windows 10 devices

We recently discovered a bug in the [Smart card removal behavior setting](/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-protection-windows-10#interactive-logon) for Windows 10 devices where the underlying setting values in Microsoft Intune for **Lock workstation** has the **No Action** behavior applied. We are rolling out a fix in Intuneâ€™s January (2201) service release, which is expected to be completed by end of the month.

### Who is impacted

If you have the value **Lock workstation** selected for the Smart card removal behavior setting configured in either your device configuration, security baselines, or Endpoint protection profiles for Windows 10 devices then you might be impacted by this issue.

### Recommended actions

Check the value selected for the Smart card removal behavior setting for existing policies. If you have the selected the value **Lock workstation**, re-save existing policies to apply the correct behavior or update the values based on your organization's needs.

> [!NOTE]
> For security baselines, you do not need to update or re-save the policies after the fix is rolled out.

## Several Office settings in the settings catalog need parent settings enabled

We recently identified several Office settings in the settings catalog that, when enabled, do not automatically enable the required parent setting. This can lead to the policy not applying as expected if you did not configure the parent setting.

To help identify which configuration settings have this behavior, we recently made a user interface (UI) change to mark them as **(deprecated)** in the Settings catalog (preview) page. We have also included a full list below.

We will release new device configuration settings (with the same name) that will automatically enforce the dependencies.

### Recommended actions

Check your device configuration profiles to see if you are using a deprecated setting and if the parent setting is enabled. If the parent setting is not enabled, update your profiles to configure the parent setting and ensure the child setting works as expected. After we release the replacement settings, you can update your configuration profile to use the new setting instead.

## Long sync times in Intune for Managed Google Play private apps and web apps

This issue affects Managed Google Play web apps and private line-of-business (LOB) apps. If you recently created or have been added to a web app and sync your tenant, it may take three to six hours or longer for you to see the apps in Intune. Google is aware of this issue and their engineering team is currently working on a fix.

### Who is impacted

Admins who recently published a new Managed Google Play web or LOB app via one of the available publishing methods (iFrame in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, the custom app publishing API, or the Google Play Console external to Intune), will notice delays for those apps to sync to Intune. After selecting **Sync** from either the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center or the Google Play console, it can take hours for the new apps to appear in the app list in Intune. 

> [!NOTE]
> Existing web and private apps are not affected, including updates or edits to those apps.

### Available workarounds

There is one available workaround for web apps for dedicated devices using Microsoft Managed Home Screen by creating and deploying web links instead of Managed Google Play web apps. In the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, go to Apps > All apps, select Add, and then choose web link as the app type.

There is no workaround for any other app type or enrollment scenario at this time.
