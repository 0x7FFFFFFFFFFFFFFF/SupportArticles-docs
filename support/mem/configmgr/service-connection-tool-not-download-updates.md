# Error when downloading the ConfigMgr.AdminUIContent.cab file by using the SMS_DMP_DOWNLOADER component or the service connection tool

When you use service connection point online mode or ServiceConnectionTool.exe to download updates in Configuration Manager, you receive an AdminUIContentDownload error.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch)  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4561945

## Symptoms

- When you have the service connection point set to online mode, you may notice that no new Configuration Manager releases appear in the console. And the following error message is logged in the DmpDownloader.log file:

  > Redirected to URL `https://configmgrbits.azureedge.net/adminuicontent/ConfigMgr.AdminUIContent.cab`~~  
  > Got fwdlink and recreating the httprequest/response~~  
  > ERROR: Failed to download Admin UI content payload with exception: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.~~  
  > Failed to call AdminUIContentDownload. error = Error -2146233079~

- You have the service connection point set to offline mode. You use the service connection tool (ServiceConnectionTool.exe) to download and import updates in Configuration Manager. A similar error message is logged in the ServiceConnectionTool.log file:

  > ERROR:AdminUIContentDownloadDownload:DownloadManifestCab exception: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send. There may be an issue with internet connection or the download link.

## Cause

This issue occurs because TLS 1.2 isn't enabled for the .NET Framework on the computer that's running the online service connection point or service connection tool. TLS 1.2 is required to download the .cab file.

## Resolution

On the computer that runs the online service connection point or service connection tool, [enable TLS 1.2](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2-server).

In particular, if .NET Framework updates are installed, set the following registry values, and then restart the computer:

Subkey: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319`

Values:

- `SystemDefaultTlsVersions` = **DWORD:00000001**  
- `SchUseStrongCrypto` = **DWORD:00000001**

## Workaround

If you use the service connection tool, manually download the ConfigMgr.AdminUIContent.cab file from [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619849](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619849). Save the file to the folder that's specified by the `-updatepackdest` parameter when you run the `serviceconnectiontool.exe` command. Then, rename the **ConfigMgr.AdminUIContent.cab** file to **ConfigMgr.AdminUIContent.auc**.
