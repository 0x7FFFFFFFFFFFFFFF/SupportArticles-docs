This article fixes an issue in which you receive error 0x800f0831 when you install a cumulative update.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch), Windows Server Update Services  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4477073

## Symptom

When you try to install a Windows update, especially a cumulative update, you receive the following error message in WindowsUpdate.log:

> FATAL: CBS called Error with 0x800f0831

This issue is more likely to occur when there is no access to Microsoft Update.

Additionally, you receive error messages that resemble the following in CBS.log:

> Store corruption, manifest missing for package: \<Missing_Package>  
> Failed to resolve package \<Missing_Package> [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Mark store corruption flag because of package: \<Missing_Package> [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to resolve package [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to get next package to re-evaluate [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to execute execution chain. [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to process single phase execution. [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> WER: Generating failure report for package:\<Failed_Package> status: 0x800f0831, failure source: Execute, start state: Staged, target state: Installed, client id: DISM Package Manager Provider  

> [!NOTE]
> \<Failed_Package> represents the package that can't be installed. \<Missing_Package> represents the package for which the manifest is missing.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the update that can't be installed requires the manifest of a previous update package.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, follow one of the methods from below:

### Method 1: Repair the component store with Dism commands

To repair component store using the Dism RestoreHealth command, follow these steps: 
1. From an elevated command prompt and run these commands:
```
DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /SCANHEALTH
```
```
DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /CHECKHEALTH
```
```
DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /RESTOREHEALTH
```
```
Sfc /Scannow
```
2. Restart the device.

### Method 2: Manually repair with the payload from the partially installed component:

1. Go to [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/).
2. In the **Search** box, enter the package ID of the \<Missing_Package>.
3. Find the update that applies to your operating system appropriately in the search results, and then select the Download button.
4. Microsoft Update Catalog select the Download button.
5. Select the link of the file to download the update.
6. Select Close after the download process is done. Then, you can find a folder that contains the update package in the location that you specified.
7. Open the folder, and then double-select the update package to install the update.
