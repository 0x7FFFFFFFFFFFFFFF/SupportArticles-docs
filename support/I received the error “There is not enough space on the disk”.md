# I received the error “There is not enough space on the disk”

## Symptom
When attempting to install Visual Studio you receive the error “There is not enough space on the disk”

## Resolution
Before installing Visual Studio make sure that you have the required amount of space for the edition of Visual Studio you desire.

Even if you want to install Visual Studio to a drive other than the system drive you will still need space on the system drive because some components will be installed there. In order to avoid this error it is recommended that you asses how much space it will take to install the components you want. Make sure that you have about 75% of the space required to install the components you want available on your system drive. To conserve space only select the packages and components you need during the initial installation of Visual Studio.
