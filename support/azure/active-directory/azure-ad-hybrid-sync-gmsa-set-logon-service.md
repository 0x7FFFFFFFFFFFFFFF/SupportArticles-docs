- The server for the provisioning agent must be Windows Server 2016 or later, domain-joined, and following directives for Tier 0 based on the Active directory administrative model.

## The gMSA is set to log on as Service

While installing Cloud Provisioning Agent, you may encounter the following error:

> Failed changing Windows service credentials to gMSA.

To resolve this issue, check the System event logs for **EventID 7038**. The following error will be displayed:

The error includes the message The user name or password is incorrect." border="true":::

When you open the **Microsoft Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent** properties, and select the **Log On** tab, you will find that the settings arenâ€™t grey out, as is expected for a managed account service.

To verify whether the account is managed, open a command prompt and type the following command: 

```console
Sc.exe qmanagedaccount aadconnectprovisioningagent
```

The account managed status will show as **False**.

The wizard will now complete successfully.
