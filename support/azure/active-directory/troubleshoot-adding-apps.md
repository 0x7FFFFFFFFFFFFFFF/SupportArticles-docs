# Troubleshoot common problems adding or removing an application to Azure Active Directory

The articles in this section provide guidance on how to troubleshoot issues that may arise when adding or removing an application in Azure Active Directory.

If you need help with learning about applications, the [List of Tutorials on How to Integrate SaaS Apps with Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list) article is a good place to start.

In addition to this, the [Azure AD Applications Document Library](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management) can help you learn more about single sign-on with Azure AD and how it works.
