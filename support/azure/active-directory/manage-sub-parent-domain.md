## Summary

Consider the following scenario:

- You have one organization (for example, `Contoso.onmicrosoft.com`) in which you want to verify and federate a parent domain (for example, `Contoso.com`).
- You have another organization (for example, `Fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com`) in which you want to verify and federate a subdomain (for example, `Sales.contoso.com`) of the parent domain.

ToÂ manage the domains in this scenario, follow these steps in the order in which they're given:

1. Submit a support request to break the inheritance at [Azure Customer Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
2. Verify and federate the subdomain.
