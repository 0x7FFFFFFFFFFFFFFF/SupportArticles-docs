# Pending devices in Azure Active Directory

Pending devices are devices that are synced to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) form your on-premises Active Directory, but they have not successfully completed registration with Azure AD device registration service. When a deviceâ€™s registered state is pending, the device is unable to complete any authorization and authentication requests, like requesting a [Primary Refresh token](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token) for single sign-on or apply [device based Conditional Access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).

## Why would a device be in a pending state?

When you configure a **Hybrid Azure AD join** task in the Azure AD Connect Sync for your on-premises devices, the task will sync the device objects to Azure AD, and temporarily set the registered state of the devices to "pending" before the device completes device registration. For more information about the device registration process, see [How it works: Device registration](/azure/active-directory/devices/device-registration-how-it-works#hybrid-azure-ad-joined-in-managed-environments).

## How does a device get stuck in a pending state?

There are two scenarios in which a device can be stuck in a pending state:

### New device to Hybrid Azure AD

If a new device is stuck in the pending state, it can happen if the device cannot complete the registration process. This problem can be caused by several factors like the device cannot connect to the registration service. To troubleshoot device registration issues, see:

- [Test Device Registration Connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/testdeviceregconnectivity/testdeviceregconnectivity/)
- [Troubleshooting hybrid Azure Active Directory joined devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/troubleshoot-hybrid-join-windows-current)

### The state of a registered device is changed to pending

This problem can happen in the following scenario:

1. The device object is moved to another organizational unit (OU) that is not in the sync scope with Azure AD.
2. Azure AD Connect Sync recognizes this as a deletion of the device object in the on-premises AD, therefore it deletes the device in Azure AD.
3. The device object was moved back to the OU in the sync scope.
4. Azure AD Connect creates a pending device object for this device.
5. The device fails to complete the device registration since it was registered before.

To fix the issue, you can un-register client by running `dsregcmd /leave` in an elevated command and restart the device. The device will re-initiate the device registration process via the scheduled task. For Windows 10 based devices, the scheduled task is under **Task Scheduler Library**> **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **Workplace Join** > **Automatic-Device-Join Task**.

### Get list of the pending devices

**Count all pending devices**

```powershell
(Get-AzureADDevice -all $true |  Where-Object{($_.DeviceTrustType -eq"ServerAd") -and ($_.ProfileType -ne"RegisteredDevice") -and (-not $_.AlternativeSecurityIds)}).count
```

**Get all pending devices and save the returned data in a CSV file**
 
 ```powershell
Get all pending devices and save the returned data in a CSV file:
Get-AzureADDevice -all $true |  Where-Object{($_.DeviceTrustType -eq"ServerAd") -and ($_.ProfileType -ne"RegisteredDevice") -and (-not $_.AlternativeSecurityIds)} | select-object -Property AccountEnabled, ObjectId, DeviceId, DisplayName, DeviceOSType, DeviceOSVersion, DeviceTrustType | export-csv pendingdevicelist-summary.csv -NoTypeInformation
```
