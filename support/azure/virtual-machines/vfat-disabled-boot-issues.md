# How to recover an Azure Linux virtual machine from no boot caused by disabling VFAT

This article provides solutions to an issue in which a Linux virtual machine (VM) can't boot after disabling the VFAT file system type.

The VFAT file system type is required by the [Endorsed Linux distributions on Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) VMs, to get the _/boot/efi_ file system mounted. The _/boot/efi_ file system is needed by the Linux Gen2 VMs (UEFI based), but it's also included in the Gen1 (BIOS Based) Linux images.

VFAT is also required by the Azure Linux VMs when they are encrypted using [Azure Disk Encryption(ADE)](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview), for both OS and data disks encryption.

Disabling VFAT will cause a no boot situation in the Azure Linux VMs. Several hardening tools disable VFAT. Make sure VFAT is excluded from the hardening and preserved enabled, to avoid this kind of issue.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the [serial console](serial-console-linux.md) is enabled and functional in the Linux VM.

## <a id="identify-vfat-disabled-boot-issue"></a>How to identify a no boot caused by disabling VFAT?

Use the Azure portal to view the serial console log output of the VM in the boot diagnostics blade, serial console blade, or [AZ CLI](/cli/azure/serial-console#az-serial-console-connect) to identify the any of the following outputs.

When VFAT has been disabled, you will face any of the following issues, or even both:

### The /boot/efi file system failing to get mounted

Below some outputs when /boot/efi file system fails to get mounted:

```output
[[1;31mFAILED[0m] Failed to mount /boot/efi.

See 'systemctl status boot-efi.mount' for details.

[[1;33mDEPEND[0m] Dependency failed for Local File Systems.

[[1;33mDEPEND[0m] Dependency failed for Migrate local... structure to the new structure.

[[1;33mDEPEND[0m] Dependency failed for Mark the need to relabel after reboot.
```

```output
[FAILED] Failed to mount /boot/efi.
See 'systemctl status boot-efi.mount' for details.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Mark the need to relabel after reboot.
```

You could also experience the following similar issue:

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In case the OS disk is not encrypted and only the data file systems were encrypted using ADE, then you will experience issues to get the data disks mounted. The same action plan should be followed when the ADE encrypted data disks failed to get mounted because VFAT has been disabled.

## <a id="online-troubleshooting"></a>Online troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM prior disabling VFAT, you may try [restoring the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot problem.

The serial console is the fastest method to resolve this issue. It allows you to directly fix the issue without having to present the system disk to a recovery VM. Make sure you have met the necessary prerequisites for your distribution. For more information, see [Virtual machine serial console for Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/serial-console#access-serial-console-for-linux).  

### <a id="online-troubleshooting-nonencrypted"></a> Non-encrypted VMs failing to get /boot/efi mounted

1. Using the [Azure serial console](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/serial-console#access-serial-console-for-linux), boot your VM in single user mode.  Follow the detailed instructions in [Use Serial Console to access GRUB and single-user mode](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-grub-single-user-mode) for further information.

>[!NOTE]
> To boot the VM in single user mode, add the _init=/bin/bash_ kernel option in the linux16 GRUB line, by interrupting the boot process at the GRUB menu level and editing the main kernel entry.

:::image type="content" source="media/vfat-disabled-boot-issues/boot-singleuser-01.gif" alt-text="Animated GIF shows the process of interrupting the boot process at GRUB menu level to boot the system in single-user.":::

2. Make sure all the required file systems are mounted and root is in read and write mode.
    1. If you booted the system using the _init=/bin/bash_ kernel option, execute the following commands to prepare the required file systems:

    ```bash
    mount -o rw,remount /
    mount -a
    ```

    2. Follow the instructions in section [Re-enable VFAT](#reenable-vfat) to get VFAT re-enabled.
    3. Restart the system.

>[!NOTE]
> If the VM is Gen1 and it's not encrypted, you could also simply comment out the /boot/efi entry from /etc/fstab, as /boot/efi is not actually needed in Gen1 VMs. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Linux VM starting issues due to fstab errors](/azure/virtual-machines/linux-virtual-machine-cannot-start-fstab-errors).

### <a id="online-troubleshooting-encrypted"></a>ADE encrypted VMs not booting up

* **VM with OS disk encrypted:**

  It isn't possible to troubleshoot this issue from the Azure serial console, when the OS disk is encrypted.

* **VM with only data disks encrypted, failing to boot due to /etc/fstab issues:**

  1. In case the VM was encrypted with only data disk(s) encryption (the OS disk isn't encrypted), you can add the **_nofail_** mount option to the corresponding entries in /etc/fstab, [from single user](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-grub-single-user-mode) using the Azure serial console, to boot up the system. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Linux VM starting issues due to fstab errors](/azure/virtual-machines/linux-virtual-machine-cannot-start-fstab-errors).

   2. Once the VM has been booted up, follow the instructions in section [Re-enable VFAT](#reenable-vfat) to get VFAT re-enabled and restart the VM.

## <a id="offline-troubleshooting"></a>Offline troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM prior disabling VFAT, you may try [restoring the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot problem.

In case the [Azure serial console](serial-console-linux.md) isn't working in the specific VM or is not an option in your subscription, this issue can also be troubleshooted using a rescue/repair VM.

### <a id="offline-troubleshooting-nonencrypted"></a>Non-encrypted VMs failing to get /boot/efi mounted

1. Use [vm repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md) to create a repair VM that has a copy of the affected VM's OS disk attached. Mount the copy of the OS file systems in the repair VM by using [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively, you can create a rescue VM manually by using the Azure portal. For more information, see [Troubleshoot a Linux VM by attaching the OS disk to a recovery VM using the Azure portal](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux).

2. Follow the instructions in section [Re-enable VFAT](#reenable-vfat) to get VFAT re-enabled.

3. After the VFAT has been re-enabled, perform the following actions:

    1. Exit chroot and unmount the copy of the file systems from the rescue/repair VM.

    2. Run the `az vm repair restore` command to swap the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM. For more information, see Step 5 in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

    3. Validate if the VM is able to boot up by taking a look at the Azure serial console or by trying to connect to the VM.

>[!NOTE]
> If the VM is Gen1 and it's not encrypted, you could also simply comment out the /boot/efi entry from /etc/fstab, as /boot/efi is not actually needed in Gen1 VMs. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Linux VM starting issues due to fstab errors](/azure/virtual-machines/linux-virtual-machine-cannot-start-fstab-errors).

### <a id="offline-troubleshooting-encrypted"></a>ADE encrypted VMs not booting up

1. Use [vm repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md) to create a repair VM that has a copy of the affected VM's OS disk attached.
2. When the VM is encrypted using ADE, the [Azure vm repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md) takes care of unlocking and mounting the encrypted file systems for you. You will see the encrypted file systems mounted as `/investigateroot/*` and `/investigateboot`. You can login to the repair VM and re-mount the file systems to the desired mount points by using the [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md) document as a reference.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively, you can create a rescue VM manually by using the Azure portal and attaching the copy of the encrypted OS disk at VM creation time. For more information, see [Troubleshoot a Linux VM by attaching the OS disk to a recovery VM using the Azure portal](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux).

2. Follow the instructions in section [Re-enable VFAT](#reenable-vfat) to get VFAT re-enabled.

3. After the VFAT has been re-enabled, perform the following actions:

    1. Exit chroot and unmount the copy of the file systems from the rescue/repair VM.

    2. Run the `az vm repair restore` command to swap the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM. For more information, see Step 5 in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

    3. Validate if the VM is able to boot up by taking a look at the Azure serial console or by trying to connect to the VM.
...

## <a id="reenable-vfat"></a>Re-enable VFAT

1. Execute the following command to identify the file(s) that are disabling VFAT and the corresponding line number(s).

```bash
grep -nr vfat /etc/modprobe.d/
```

2. Modify the corresponding file and comment out or delete the VFAT entry. The entry will most commonly be: _install vfat /bin/true_

```bash
vi /etc/modprobe.d/disable.conf
```

>[!NOTE]
> Replace **_disable.conf_** with the corresponding file name where VFAT is being disabled.

3. Use the below corresponding command to regenerate the initramfs file.

* **If executed from the Azure serial console:**

  * **RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7/8**

    ```bash
    dracut -f /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)
    ```

  * **SLES 12/15**

    ```bash
    dracut -f /boot/initrd-$(uname -r) $(uname -r)
    ```

  * **Ubuntu 18.04**

    ```bash
    mkinitramfs -k -o /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r)
    ```

* **If executed from a repair/rescue VM:**

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure the [Offline Troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting) step 1 has been already followed and these commands are executed inside [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md).

  * **RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7/8**
