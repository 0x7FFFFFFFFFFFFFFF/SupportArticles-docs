# Troubleshoot virtual network integration with Azure App Service

This article describes tools that you can use to troubleshoot connection issues in Azure App Service. These tools [integrate with a virtual network](/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration).

> [!NOTE]  
> Virtual network integration isn't supported for Docker Compose scenarios in App Service. Access restriction policies are ignored if a private endpoint is present.

## Verify virtual network integration

To troubleshoot connection issues, you must first verify whether the virtual network integration is configured correctly and whether the private IP is assigned to all instances of the App Service Plan.

To do this, use one of the following methods.

### Check the private IP in the Kudu Debug console

To access the Kudu console, select the app service in the Azure portal, go to **Development Tools**, select **Advanced Tools**, and then select **Go**. In the Kudu service page, select **Tools** > **Debug Console** > **CMD**.

You can also go to the Kudu Debug console directly by using the URL, `[sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`.

In the Debug console, run one of the following commands.

**Windows OS-based apps**

```console
SET WEBSITE_PRIVATE_IP
```
If the private IP is assigned successfully, you'll get the following output:

```output
WEBSITE_PRIVATE_IP=<IP address>
```

**Linux OS-based apps**

```console
set| egrep --color 'WEBSITE_PRIVATE_IP'
```

### Check the private IP in the Kudu environment

Go to the Kudu environment at `[sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net/Env`, and then search for `WEBSITE_PRIVATE_IP`.

After you verify that the virtual network integration is configured successfully, you can proceed to the connectivity test.

## Troubleshoot outbound connectivity on Windows apps

In native Windows apps, the tools **ping**, **nslookup**, and **tracert** won't work through the console because of security constraints (they work in custom Windows containers).

Go to the Kudu console directly at `[sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`.

To test DNS functionality, use **nameresolver.exe**. The syntax is as follows:

```console
nameresolver.exe hostname [optional:DNS Server]
```

You can use **nameresolver** to check the hostnames that your app depends on. In this manner, you can test whether anything is misconfigured on your DNS server, and verify that you have access to your DNS server. In the console, you can see the DNS server that your app uses by looking at the environmental variables, WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER and WEBSITE_DNS_ALT_SERVER.

> [!NOTE]  
> The nameresolver.exe tool currently doesnâ€™t work in custom Windows containers.

To test TCP connectivity to a host and port combination, you can use **tcpping**. The syntax is as follows:

```console
tcpping.exe hostname [optional: port]
```

The **tcpping** tool tells you whether you can reach a specific host and port. It can show success only if there's an application that's listening at the host and port combination, and if there's network access from your app to the specified host and port.

## Troubleshoot outbound connectivity on Linux apps

Go to Kudu directly at `[sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net`. In the Kudu service page, select **Tools** > **Debug Console** > **CMD**.

To test DNS functionality, use the command, **nslookup**. The syntax is as follows:

```console
nslookup hostname [optional:DNS Server]
```

Depending on the previous results, you can check whether something is misconfigured on your DNS server.

> [!NOTE]  
> The nameresolver.exe tool currently doesn't work in Linux apps.

To test connectivity, use the **Curl** command. The syntax is as follows:

```console
curl -v https://hostname
curl hostname:[port]
```

## Debug access to virtual network-hosted resources

Several factors can prevent your app from reaching a specific host and port. Usuaully, the cause is one of the following issues:

* **A firewall is in the way.** If you have a firewall in operation, you encountered a TCP time-out. In this case, the TCP time-out value is 21 seconds. Use the **tcpping** tool to test connectivity. TCP time-outs can have many causes besides firewalls. But this is the most likely cause.
* **DNS isn't accessible.** The DNS time-out is 3 seconds per DNS server. If you have two DNS servers, the time-out is 6 seconds. Use nameresolver to see whether DNS is working. In this situation, you can't use nslookup because that process doesn't use the DNS that your virtual network is configured for. If the DNS is inaccessible, you could have a firewall or NSG blocking access, or the DNS could be down.

If the issue persists, examine the following possible causes.

**Regional virtual network integration**

* Are the following conditions true?  
   * Your destination is a non-RFC1918 address.
   * You don't have **Route All** enabled.
* Is there an NSG blocking egress from your integration subnet?
* If you're going across Azure ExpressRoute or a VPN, is your on-premises gateway configured to route traffic back to Azure? If you can reach endpoints in your virtual network but not on-premises, check your routes.
* Do you have appropriate permissions to set delegation on the integration subnet? During regional virtual network integration configuration, your integration subnet is delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms. The VNet integration UI delegates the subnet to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms automatically. If your account doesn't have sufficient networking permissions to set delegation, then someone who can set attributes on your integration subnet will have to delegate the subnet. To manually delegate the integration subnet, go to the Azure Virtual Network subnet UI, and set the delegation for Microsoft.Web/serverFarms.

Debugging networking issues is challenging because you can't see what's blocking access to a specific host:port combination. Some possible causes include:

* You have a firewall set up on your host that prevents access to the application port from your point-to-site IP range. Crossing subnets often requires public access.
* Your target host is down.
* Your application is down.
* You had the wrong IP or hostname.
* Your application is listening on a different port than what you expect. You can match your process ID with the listening port by using "netstat -aon" on the endpoint host.
* Your network security groups are configured to prevent access to your application host and port from your point-to-site IP range.

You don't know what address your app actually uses. It could be any address in the integration subnet or point-to-site address range. Therefore, you have to allow access from the entire address range.

## Additional troubleshooting steps

* Connect to a VM in your virtual network, and try to reach your resource host:port from there. To test for TCP access, use the PowerShell command, **Test-NetConnection**. The syntax is as follows:
   
```powershell
Test-NetConnection hostname [optional: -Port]
```

* Open an application on a VM, and test access to that host and port from the console from within your app by using **tcpping**.

## Network troubleshooter

You can also use the Network troubleshooter to troubleshoot the connection issues for the apps in the App Service. To open the network troubleshooter, go to the app service in the Azure portal, select **Diagnostic and solve problem**, and then search for **Network troubleshooter**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **connection issues** scenario doesn't support Linux or container-based apps yet.

**Connection issues**: This troubleshooter checks the status of the virtual network integration, including whether the Private IP is assigned to all instances of the App Service Plan and the DNS settings. If a custom DNS isn't configured, default Azure DNS will be applied. You can also run tests against a specific endpoint that you want to test connectivity to.

**Configuration issues**: This troubleshooter checks whether your subnet is valid for virtual network Integration.

**Subnet/VNet deletion issue**: This troubleshooter checks whether your subnet has any locks, and also whether it has any unused Service Association Links that might be blocking the deletion of the VNet/subnet.
