# Identify whether an email is from Microsoft support

Microsoft support agents use the following domains to send emails to our customers:

- microsoft.com
- microsoftsupport.com
- mail.support.microsoft.com

If the email claims to be from Microsoft, but the email is being sent from another email domain like microsoftsupport.ru, it's probably a scam. In this case, please report it by submitting an issue.
