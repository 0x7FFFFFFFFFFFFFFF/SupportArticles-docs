# Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics diagnostic logs

To troubleshoot issues that are related to Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, Microsoft Support and the Azure Synapse Analytics engineering team can view and download diagnostic logs that are associated with your Apache Spark pools. Microsoft may access or make temporary copies of the data to help resolve your support incident.

## Logs collected for troubleshooting

The following table explains the kinds of data that are associated with your Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and that may be accessed while we troubleshoot your support incident.
