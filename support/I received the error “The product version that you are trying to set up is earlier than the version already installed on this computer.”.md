# I received the error “The product version that you are trying to set up is earlier than the version already installed on this computer.”

## Symptom
When attempting to install Visual Studio you receive the following error “The product version that you are trying to set up is earlier than the version already installed on this computer.”

## Resolution
Check to make sure that the version of Visual Studio 2015 you are downloading is not earlier than the current version or update you are installing. If you determine that the version of Visual Studio you are downloading is not earlier than the existing, please see this [MSDN Post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/abaecb1a-2ed6-4c9d-9676-794039ba3422/visual-studio-community-2015-setup-blocked-the-product-version-that-you-are-trying-to-set-up-is?forum=vssetup) for guidance in resolving this issue.
