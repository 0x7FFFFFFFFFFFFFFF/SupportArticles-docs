# I received the error “The product version is old compared to the one already installed.”

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptom
When you try to install Visual Studio you receive the following error:

“The product version that you are trying to set up is earlier than the version already installed on this computer.”

## Resolution
Verify that the version of Visual Studio 2015 you are downloading is not earlier than the current version or update you are installing. If you determine that the version of Visual Studio you are downloading is not earlier than the existing, please see this [MSDN Post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/abaecb1a-2ed6-4c9d-9676-794039ba3422/visual-studio-community-2015-setup-blocked-the-product-version-that-you-are-trying-to-set-up-is?forum=vssetup) for guidance in resolving this issue.
