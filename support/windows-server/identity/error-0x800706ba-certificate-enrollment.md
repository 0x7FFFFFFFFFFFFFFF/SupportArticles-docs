# Error 0x800706ba "The RPC Server is unavailable" when you enroll a certificate

When you try to enroll a certificate on a Windows Server, it fails with the error 0x800706ba "The RPC Server is unavailable". This article introduces how to solve this issue.

_Applies to:_ Supported versions of Windows Server  
_Original KB number:_ 4042719, 4516764, 5021150  

## Symptoms

When you troubleshoot this issue, you may see one or more of the following symptoms.

> [!NOTE]
> When the issue occurs, if we add the user account that is used to request the certificate to the local administrators group on the CA, the enrollment succeeds for a user-based template. However, enrollment against a machine based template still returns the same error.

### Error messages

You receive error messages that resemble the following during certificate enrollment.

### Network capture

In network trace, you can find LDAP queries to the configuration partition in Active Directory was successful, and the templates available are revealed in the trace.

Then, the requesting server try to do RPC to the CA and get the response ACCESS DENIED.

For example:

> 10167 \<time\> \<requesting server IP address\> \<CA IP address\> ISystemActivator 918 RemoteCreateInstance request  
> 10174 \<time\> \<CA IP address\> \<requesting server IP address\> DCERPC 86 Fault: call_id: 3, Fragment: Single, Ctx: 1, **status: nca_s_fault_access_denied**

Additionally, you can find MSRPC bind attempt and error:

> 1093    \<time\>    92.5590216     (0)    SourceIP    52237 (0xCC0D)    DestIP    135 (0x87)    MSRPC    MSRPC:c/o Bind: IRemoteSCMActivator(DCOM) UUID{000001A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}  Call=0x3  Assoc Grp=0x8A9E  Xmit=0x16D0  Recv=0x16D0  
> 1097    \<time\>    92.5940283     (652)    SourceIP    135 (0x87)    DestIP    52237 (0xCC0D)    MSRPC    MSRPC:c/o Bind Nack:  Call=0x3  **Reject Reason: invalid_checksum**

### Event log

If auditing is enabled, a DCOM error can be observed on the CA server detailing an **ANONYMOUS LOGON** attempt:

> Log Name: System  
> Source: Microsoft-Windows-DistributedCOM  
> Date: \<date\>  
> Event ID: 10027  
> Task Category: None  
> Level: Warning  
> Keywords: Classic  
> User: ANONYMOUS LOGON  
> Computer: \<CA FQDN\>
>
> Description:  
> The machine wide limit settings do not grant Remote Activation permission for COM Server applications to the user NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON SID (S-1-5-7) from address \<IP address\> running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.

### Other symptom and logs

- The call should be made with **dce_c_authn_level_pkt_integrity** RPC Integrity level that enforces Kerberos/NTLM as an authentication mechanism. This behavior is enforced by default starting 6B.22 [KB5004442â€”Manage changes for Windows DCOM Server Security Feature Bypass (CVE-2021-26414)](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5004442-manage-changes-for-windows-dcom-server-security-feature-bypass-cve-2021-26414-f1400b52-c141-43d2-941e-37ed901c769c).
- When the client sends a KRB_AP_REQ request, it's rejected by the server side.
- On the server side, the kerberos.etl displays the following entries:

  > [0] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] krbtoken_cxx3567 KerbCreateTokenFromTicketEx() - KerbCreateTokenFromTicket for \<user account\>, (null)  
  > [0] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] krbtoken_cxx3595 **KerbCreateTokenFromTicketEx() - Failed to create token: 0xc000015b**  
  > [2] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] logonapi_cxx9910 LsaApLogonTerminated() - LsaApLogonTerminated called: 0x0:0xf4eb9b0  
  > [2] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] ctxtapi_cxx4235 SpAcceptLsaModeContext() - Failed to create token from ticket: 0xc000015b  
  > [2] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] ctxtapi_cxx5078 SpAcceptLsaModeContext() - SpAcceptLsaModeContext returned 0xc000015b, Context 0000000000000000, Pid 0x0  
  > [2] 02B4.11CC::\<date and time\> [KERBEROS] ctxtapi_cxx5079 SpAcceptLsaModeContext() - SpAcceptLsaModeContext (0000000000000000) returned 0xc000015b

- The server try to procure an access token for the user who presented the TGS and fails with 0xc000015b - "STATUS_LOGON_TYPE_NOT_GRANTED".

## Cause

This issue occurs because the group policy "Access this computer from the network" is set and the user account used to enroll the certificate isn't added.

The group policy locates at: Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Assignment

By default, the policy is populated by the groups: Administrators, Backup Operators, Everyone, Users.

Because the user account that is used for certificate enrollment fails authentication by using Kerberos, the authentication mechanism is downgraded to anonymous logon. The logon fails on the DCOM level.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, add the approach user groups to the group policy. For example:
