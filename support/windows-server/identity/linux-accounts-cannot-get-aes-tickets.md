# Linux accounts can't get AES encrypted tickets in AD DS

## Symptoms

In an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment, Linux integrated accounts receive RC4 tickets instead of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encrypted tickets when using Kerberos authentication. Go to the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to troubleshoot this issue.

- In the log of Event ID 4769, the value of **Ticket Encryption Type** is **0x17** for the affected computer. That corresponds to an RC4 encryption type.

    ```output
    Source: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing 
    Event ID: 4769 
    Task Category: Kerberos Service Ticket Operations 
    Level: Information 
    Computer: MyDC.contoso.com 
    Description: 
    A Kerberos service ticket was requested. 
    … 
    Service Information: 
    Service Name: MYLINUX 
    Service ID: CONTOSO\MYLINUX 
    Network Information: 
    Client Address: ::ffff:10.20.30.40 
    Client Port: 57499 
    Additional Information: 
    Ticket Options: 0x40810000 
    Ticket Encryption Type: 0x17 
    Failure Code: 0x0 
    Transited Services: -
    ```

- After running the [`klist`](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/klist) command, the value of **KerbTicket Encryption Type** is **RSADSI RC4-HMAC(NT)**. That means the encryption type is RC4.

    ```output
    C:\> Klist get MYLINUX@CONTOSO.COM  
    Current LogonId is 0:0xb532bccf  
    A ticket to MYLINUX@CONTOSO.COM has been retrieved successfully.

    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the **msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes** attribute value to *24 (0x18)* to force AES256/AES128 encryption won't solve the issue, nor will changing the encryption type allowed for Kerberos using the **Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos** GPO to disable the RC4 encryption and enable the AES encryption type.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the **operatingSystemVersion** attribute value of Linux is set to *3.10.0x*. AD DS reads the attribute value from left to right, stopping at the first decimal point (.) If the first character of the value is a digit and smaller than six (in this case, the value is 3), the KDC determines that the requesting operating system might not support newer encryption types. As a result, the KDC ignores **msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes** and uses RC4 to encrypt the ticket.

This behavior is by design. It accommodates older versions of Windows (Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP) that do not support the **msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes** attribute and the AES encryption type. The following specifications describe this design:<a id="1"></a>

- If the server or [service](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/e720dd17-0703-4ce4-ab66-7ccf2d72c579#gt_2dc07ca2-2b40-437e-a5ec-ed28ebfb116a) has a **KerbSupportedEncryptionTypes** populated with supported encryption types,[<58>](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/1163bb03-7035-433e-b5a4-802247262d18#Appendix_A_58) then the KDC SHOULD[<59>](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/1163bb03-7035-433e-b5a4-802247262d18#Appendix_A_59) return in the encrypted part ([[Referrals-11]](https://tools.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-referrals-11) Appendix A) of **TGS-REP** message, a **PA-DATA** structure with padata-type set to **PA-SUPPORTED-ENCTYPES** [165] to indicate what encryption types (section [2.2.7](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/6cfc7b50-11ed-4b4d-846d-6f08f0812919)) are supported by the server or service. If not, the KDC SHOULD[<60>](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/1163bb03-7035-433e-b5a4-802247262d18#Appendix_A_60) check the server or service account's UseDESOnly flag.

- <58> Section 3.3.5.7: When the account is for a computer object and the value of **OperatingSystemVersion** ([[MS-ADA3]](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-ada3/4517e835-3ee6-44d4-bb95-a94b6966bfb0) section 2.56) is less than 6, **KerbSupportedEncryptionTypes** is treated as if it were not populated to ensure that newer encryption types are not attempted with Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, which do not support setting **KerbSupportedEncryptionTypes**.

For more information, see the specifications in [TGS Exchange](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/2e5dcf34-4b51-44a0-b45a-277ed616ca39#:~:text=if%20the%20server%20or%20service,usedesonly%20flag) and [Appendix A <58>](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/1163bb03-7035-433e-b5a4-802247262d18#Appendix_A_58) of Kerberos protocol extensions.

## Solution

To solve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Remove the **operatingSystemVersion** attribute.
- Set the attribute value not start with a numeric digit, such as *Linux 3.10.0x* instead of *3.10.0x*.
- Upgrade to an updated system version from the third party vendor (for example Linux) to comply with the [specifications](#1).
