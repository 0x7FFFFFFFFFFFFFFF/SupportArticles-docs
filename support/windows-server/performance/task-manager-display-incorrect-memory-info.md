# Task Manager may display incorrect memory information

This article provides a workaround for an issue in which Task Manager shows the memory speed to be higher or lower than the speed that is reported in the BIOS.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 â€“ all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3070928

## Symptoms

When you view memory information in Windows Task Manager, the values that are displayed for reserved hardware and for speed may differ from what is reported in other sources. For example, Task Manager may show the memory speed to be higher or lower than the speed that is reported in the BIOS.

## Cause

This issue occurs because Task Manager parses the SMBIOS memory data incorrectly.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use an alternative source to view memory information. For example, Resource Monitor displays the correct value of the hardware reserved memory and is included in Windows 7 and later versions.
