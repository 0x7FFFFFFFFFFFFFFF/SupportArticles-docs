# Error after completing configuration of the RD Connection Broker server for high availability

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2016

## Symptoms

You receive this error message after completing [the configuration of the Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker) server for high availability](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-connection-broker-cluster#step-3-configure-the-connection-brokers-for-high-availability).

> Could not create the database \<DatabaseName>. Please check that the broker server has access to the SQL server, the path for -DatabaseFilePath parameter exists and contains the SQL Server database file, the connection to SQL database is correct and SQL database is online. See the SQL Server and broker event log for more details.

## Resolution

1. Make sure the information in the **Database connection string** field is correct when [configuring the RD Connection Broker server for high availability](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-connection-broker-cluster#step-3-configure-the-connection-brokers-for-high-availability). Here's how the string looks like:

    DRIVER=SQL Server Native Client \<VersionNumber>;SERVER=\<SQL Server Name>;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;Database=\<New database file name>

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - The string value is case-sensitive. Make sure the value for "Trusted_Connection" is "Yes" and not "YES".
    > - Make sure the SQL Server Native Client version is compatible with the SQL server.
    > - Don't include the file extension when you input the file name into the string.

2. Make sure the correct permission has been assigned to the RD Connection Broker server on the SQL server. Here's how to do this:

    1. Sign in to the SQL server.
    2. Open **Microsoft SQL Management Studio**.
    3. Go to **Security** > **Logins** in **Object Explorer**, right-click the RD Connection Broker server, and select **Properties**.
    4. Make sure the **dbcreator** and **public** checkboxes are selected under the **Server roles** pane.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The RD Connection Broker server is now allowed to create databases in the SQL server. The RD Connection Broker service will attempt to migrate Windows Internal Database (WID) to a SQL Server instance when converting the RD Connection Broker server to a high available cluster.
