# PowerShell console characters are garbled for Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages on Windows Server 2022

This article provides a resolution to an issue that characters in PowerShell console getting garbled.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows PowerShell
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;

## Symptom

When you launch PowerShell console the characters are getting garbbled. This applies only to Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages SKUs.

## Cause

Windows PowerShell .lnk shortcut is hardcoded to Consolas font, by default. This font doesn't have the glyphs for CJK characters so they aren't rendered correctly. Changing to MSGothic explicitly will fix this as MSGothic has glyphs for CJK. The reason cmd.exe works is that the cmd .lnk shortcut doesn't specify a font, so the console chooses the right one at runtime depending on your language. A similar fix is being made in Windows, but won't be backported.

## Resolution

The issue will be fixed in Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 very soon, but this will not be backported to lower versions. To fix the issue, there are 2 workarounds listed below. Either of them can be used.

## Workaround 1: Launch the Powershell from cmd.exe

Start cmd.exe and run powershell.exe from within the cmd console. This opens up a PowerShell console without any font issues.

## Workaround 2: Change the font in the Powershell console

Start PowerShell the normal way. Right click on the Top bar of PowerShell console, select Properties-> Font tab. Goto Font, select `MS Gothic` and click OK. This should resolve the issue.
