### Payroll module year-end details

#### Step 1: Verify that you have installed the latest 2021 payroll tax update

Download the latest tax table update and installation instructions for 2021 to ensure your FICA Wage Limit is correct. To access the **U.S. Payroll Tax Update** pages, select the **US Taxes** link for your version within the [Microsoft Dynamics GP Resource Directory](/dynamics-gp/resources) page or select the link below:

[U.S. Payroll Tax Update for Microsoft Dynamics GP](/dynamics/s-e/gp/tugp2018_391)

> [!NOTE]
> To check your tax table update date, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** > **Tools** > **Setup** > **System** > **Payroll Tax**. The Last Tax Update should be 12/18/2020 (Round 1 for 2021) or later (if later tax updates were installed during the year).

#### Step 2: Complete all pay runs for the current year

#### Step 3: (Optional:) Complete all monthly and quarterly payroll month-end, period-end, or quarter-end procedures for the current year

For more information about period-end procedures for payroll for Microsoft Dynamics GP, use the [Printable guides](/previous-versions/dynamics-gp/appuser-itpro/jj673202(v=gp.30)) to obtain the printable manual for U.S. Payroll.

#### Step 4: Make a backup of the original file

Create a backup, and then put this backup into safe, permanent storage. By creating a backup, you make sure that you have a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year. You can restore the backup to quickly recover data if a power fluctuation or other problem occurs during the year-end closing procedure.

To create a backup in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** > **Maintenance** > **Backup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Back Up Company** window opens.
2. In the **Company Name** list, select your company name.
3. Change the path of the backup file if it's required, and then select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that you name this backup **2021 Pre Year-End Update** to differentiate it from your other backups.

#### Step 5: Install the 2021 year-end update

To install the payroll year-end update, you must follow the steps in the Microsoft Dynamics GP U.S. 2021 Year-end document. The install must be performed on each computer that has Microsoft Dynamics GP installed. When the update is released, install the update and download the 2021 Year End document from the following location:

[U.S. Year-End Update for Microsoft Dynamics GP](/dynamics/s-e/gp/usgpye2018_396)

> [!NOTE]
> Review the [US21YE](/dynamics-gp/payroll/us-year-end) and [W-2 DataSource](/dynamics-gp/payroll/w-2-statement) documents for details of what is included in the Year End Update, checklists to follow, FAQ, year-end procedures, electronic W2s, reporting and more.

#### Step 7: Make a backup of the new file

Create a backup, and then put this backup into safe, permanent storage. By creating a backup, you make sure that you have a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year.

To set up fiscal periods for the next year, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** > **Tools** > **Setup** > **Company** > **Fiscal Periods**.
2. In the **Year** field, type *2022*, and then select **Calculate**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may want to close all periods except period 1 to prevent users from posting to future periods. This is a "soft-close" and just prevents users from posting transactions to these dates or periods.

3. Select **OK**.

#### Step 14: (Optional:) Close fiscal periods for the payroll series for 2021

You can use the **Fiscal Periods Setup** window to lock down all fiscal periods that are still open for the year. By closing or locking down any fiscal periods, you prevent users from accidentally posting transactions to the wrong period or to the wrong year.

Before you close a fiscal period, verify that you've posted all transactions for the period and for the year for all modules. To later post a transaction to a fiscal period that you've closed, you must first reopen the period in the **Fiscal Periods Setup** window.

To lock down posting in a fiscal period, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** > **Tools** > **Setup** > **Company** > **Fiscal Periods**.

2. Select the **Payroll** check box for each **Period** that you close.

#### Step 15: Install the payroll tax update for 2022

> [!NOTE]
> Do not install the payroll tax update for 2022 until the year-end file has been created for 2021.

To install the payroll tax update for the new year, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** > **Maintenance** > **U.S. Payroll Updates** > **Check for Tax Updates**.
2. In the **Tax Update Method** window, select **Automatic**, and then select **Next**.
3. In the **Authorization Number** field, type your authorization number, and then select **Log in**.
4. Select **Finish**.

### FAQ

Q1: Can I install the U.S. Payroll Year-End Update PRIOR to finishing all my pay runs for the current year?

Yes, you can. The Year-End update is released early to give you plenty of time to install it. The important thing to remember is that you run the Year-End Wage file and finish all 2021 pay runs for the current year BEFORE you install any Tax Updates for the next year. When you process your first pay run for the new year, you want to make sure you have the newest tax tables and FICA limits for January 1, 2022 in place so you get the correct taxes calculated for the new year.

The key to remember is that you have THAT YEAR'S taxes in place when you perform any action for that year. (Have the 2021 taxes in place when you create the year-end wage file and perform all your 2021 pay runs, and have the 2022 taxes in place when you process the first pay run of the next year.)

Q2: Where can I get more information on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) functionality in Microsoft Dynamics GP?

1. Refer to our latest blog article about ACA: (Link will be updated at a later time)

2. Visit the [Microsoft Dynamics GP Resource](/dynamics-gp/resources) page. Scroll to the **On This Page** section and open the *Module Information* link. Select ACA/Year End to open a document that included information about complying with ACA and other information about other year-end changes.

3. There were several blog articles written to cover the ACA changes and functionality. All the blog links are listed in [ACA blog links for Microsoft Dynamics GP](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/aca-blog-links-for-microsoft-dynamics-gp-619fbabb-6211-7d46-55a8-822aac413674).
