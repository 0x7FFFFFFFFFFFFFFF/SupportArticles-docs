# “There is not enough space on the disk” error when you try to install Visual Studio

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptoms
When you try to install Microsoft Visual Studio, you receive the following error message:

“There is not enough space on the disk”

## Resolution
before you install Visual Studio, make sure that you have the required amount of space to be able to download the latest Visual Studio program or components.

Even if you want to install Visual Studio to a drive other than the system drive, you still must have sufficient space on the system drive for the installation because some components will be installed there. To avoid this error, we recommend that you first determine the space that will be required to install the components that you want. Make sure you have about 75 percent of the space required to be able install the components that you want. To conserve space, select only the packages and components that you require during the initial installation.
