# Error “There is not enough space on the disk”

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptom
When you try to install Visual Studio you receive the error “There is not enough space on the disk”

## Resolution
Prior to installing Visual Studio make sure that you have the required amount of space for the edition of Visual Studio.

Even if you want to install Visual Studio to a drive other than the system drive you will still need space on the system drive because some components will be installed. To avoid this issue, it is recommended that you determine the space it will take to install the components you want. Make sure you have about 75% of the space required to install the components you want. To conserve space select only the packages and components you require during the initial installation.
