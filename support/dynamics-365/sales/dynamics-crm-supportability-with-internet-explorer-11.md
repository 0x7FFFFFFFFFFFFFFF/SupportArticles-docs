## Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 On-Premises

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Update Rollup 2 will deliver support for Internet Explorer 11.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 was released in November 2013. It introduces a reimagined user interface that delivers a new experience to your Windows desktop and portable device of choice (Microsoft Surface, iPad, or Nexus Android device). The new UI increases and streamlines productivity for all users.

For existing customers (that is, for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 customers), we highly recommend that organizations upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 so that users can start to take advantage of these new features and productivity improvements while they take advantage of the power of Internet Explorer 11. This is very important for customers who updated or plan to update Windows devices to Windows 8.1 or who updated or plan to update user browsers to Internet Explorer 11. (Windows 8.1 comes preloaded with Internet Explorer 11.)

New customers receive all the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 benefits immediately.
