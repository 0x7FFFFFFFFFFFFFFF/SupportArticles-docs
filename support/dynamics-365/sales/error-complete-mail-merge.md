# The Create Activities screen does not display when a Mail Merge is completed against a non-default Organization in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Client for Outlook

## Symptoms

Create Activities screen will not pop up when you complete mail merge against non-default Organization in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Client for Microsoft Office Outlook. If you perform the mail merge against the default organization, it works as expected.

The Create Activities feature for Mail Merge only works with the default organization.

## Status

This is by design.
