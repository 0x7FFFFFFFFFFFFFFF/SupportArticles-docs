## Cause

The user does not have a Microsoft Dynamics 365 license assigned or the owning user has their Access Mode set to Administrative.

## Resolution

### Verify the user has a Microsoft Dynamics 365 license

Assign a Microsoft Dynamics 365 license to the user. Refer to the **Add a license to a user account** section of the [Create users and assign security roles](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles) article.

> [!NOTE]
> After assigning the Microsoft Dynamics 365 license to the user, it may take a few minutes for this change to sync from Office 365 to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

### Verify the user is not in Administrative access mode

1. Sign in to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 organization as a user with the System Administrator role.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and then select **Email Configuration**.
3. Select **Mailboxes**.
4. Change the selected view from My Active Mailboxes to **Active Mailboxes**.
5. Open the user's mailbox record.
6. Select the user selected in the **Owner** field to open the User record.
7. Expand the **Administration** tab.
8. Verify the **Access Mode** is set to **Read-Write**.

### Test and Enable the mailbox again

1. Open the mailbox record if it is not already open.
2. Select the **Test & Enable Mailbox** button.
3. Wait for the Test & Enable process to complete. If the test results are not Success, review the **Alerts** area within the mailbox record.
