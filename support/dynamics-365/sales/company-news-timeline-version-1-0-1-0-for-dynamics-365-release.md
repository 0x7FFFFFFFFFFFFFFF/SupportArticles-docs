## Upgrade to Company News Timeline version 1.0.1.0 for Microsoft Dynamics 365

This release includes an updated solution package. If you are deploying a new Company News Timeline solution after this update is available, the deployment will automatically include all of the enhancements within this update. However, if you have installed the Company News Timeline solution prior to this update, you must upgrade the solutions within Microsoft Dynamics 365. For instructions on how to upgrade the solutions, refer to the steps below:

1. Navigate and sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center with administrative privileges, then navigate to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Administration Center.
2. Select the instance that has the Company News Timeline solution installed and select the **Solutions** option in the right pane to reach the **Manage your solutions** page.
3. On this page, select the Company News Timeline solution that was previously deployed and an **Upgrade Available** option will be available within the right pane.
4. Select the **Upgrade** button. The status of the solution will change to **Installation pending**, followed by **Installed** when the upgrade process is complete.

## Changes introduced in Company News Timeline version 1.0.1.0

The functionality supported by the Company News Timeline uses Bing News APIs, and the v1.0.1.0 release updates the Bing News APIs to the latest version as the earlier version has been deprecated. This is a mandatory upgrade, as functionality will stop working once the older Bing News APIs are fully removed.
