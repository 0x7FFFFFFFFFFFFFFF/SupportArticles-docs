# Email cannot be sent because the email address of the mailbox requires an approval by an Office 365 administrator

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when you try to test and enable a mailbox in Microsoft Dynamics 365.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics CRM  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4052727

## Symptoms

When you attempt to test and enable a mailbox in Dynamics 365, one of the following alerts is logged:

- > Email cannot be sent because the email address of the mailbox \<Mailbox Name> requires an approval by an Office 365 administrator. The mailbox didn't synchronize. The owner of the email server profile Microsoft Exchange Online  has been notified.  
**Email Server Error Code:**  OutgoingEmailS2SApprovalNeeded

- > Email cannot be received because the email address of the mailbox \<Mailbox Name> requires an approval by an Office 365 administrator. The mailbox didn't synchronize. A notification about this is posted on the alerts wall for the owner of the email server profile Microsoft Exchange Online.  
**Email Server Error Code:**  IncomingEmailS2SApprovalNeeded

- > Appointments, contacts, and tasks can't be synchronized because the email address of the mailbox \<Mailbox Name> requires an approval by an Office 365 administrator. A notification about this is posted on the alerts wall for the owner of the email server profile Microsoft Exchange Online.  
**Email Server Error Code:**  ExchangeSyncEmailS2SApprovalNeeded

## Cause

When using Dynamics 365 (online) with Exchange Online, the email address for a mailbox record needs to be approved by an Office 365 user with the [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## Resolution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Sign into Dynamics 365 (online) as a user with the following privileges:

    - Global Administrator or Exchange Administrator role in Office 365
    - System Administrator role in Dynamics 365

1. Navigate to **Settings**, and then select **Email Configuration**.
1. Select **Mailboxes**.
1. Change the view from my **My Active Mailboxes** to **Active Mailboxes**.
1. Select the mailbox, and then select the **Approve Email** button.
1. After the mailbox is approved, you can select the mailbox and then select the **Test & Enable Mailboxes**  button.

> [!NOTE]
> If the test results are something other than success, you can open the mailbox record and select the Alerts section. View the details of any errors that were logged.
