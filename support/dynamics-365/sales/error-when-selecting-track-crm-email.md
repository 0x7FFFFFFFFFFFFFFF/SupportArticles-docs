## Symptoms

When you select **Track** in CRM within Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook and the email is from a sender that doesn't exist as a record in CRM, the following error occurs:

> "You do not have permission to access these records. Contact your Microsoft Dynamics CRM administrator.Item Name = \<subject of email>"

## Cause

Your user record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM is missing read access for the Queue entity. Microsoft is aware of this issue and is investigating for a potential fix. In the meantime, you can use the workaround provided in the Resolution section.

## Resolution

Sign into Microsoft Dynamics CRM as a user with the System Administrator role. Locate the security role assigned to the user. On the **Core Records** tab of the security role, grant Read access for the Queue entity.
