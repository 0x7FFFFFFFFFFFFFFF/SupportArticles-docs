# Cannot track emails in Microsoft Dynamics CRM App for Outlook

This article provides a resolution for the message **Can't track this email** that occurs when you open the Microsoft Dynamics CRM App for Microsoft Outlook.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3163174

## Symptoms

When you open the Microsoft Dynamics CRM App for Microsoft Outlook, a yellow bar appears at the top of the screen that reads: **Can't track this email**.

## Cause

Tracking of emails from the Compose Email view for Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016 clients is not currently supported.

## Resolution

Until tracking of emails during email composition is supported in Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016, you must first send the email and then track the email from your Sent Items folder. Alternatively, you may instead use Outlook Web Access using your web browser to track emails during composition.
