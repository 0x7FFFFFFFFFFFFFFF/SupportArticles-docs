# Microsoft Dynamics CRM IPv6 Supportability

This article describes the supportability of IPv6 with Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2700059

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online requires IPv4 to connect to the Dynamics CRM application. We currently do not offer support for users connecting to the Dynamics CRM Online application from networks that exclusively use IPv6. Users can connect from networks that use both IPv4 and IPv6. We will be looking to address this need in a future update to the Online Service.
