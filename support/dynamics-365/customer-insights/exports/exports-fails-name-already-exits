# Exports fail with error stating that the following name already exists

If an export tries to create a new segment in the export destination but there's already a segment with that name, then it is worth reviewing all exports to that destination for segments which are exported several times.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator permissions in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. Alternative: Contributor permissions in combination with receiving sharing access to the connection used for this export destination.
- Note the name mentioned in the error message. 

## Symptoms

A specific exports run fails with the error message mentioning that "the following name already exists" followed by the string that matches with output table name of a specific segment. 
If this error happens repeatedly across Customer insights' system refreshes, then it's likely the your exports from Customer insights are setup to export the same segment several times to the same destination, which in rare cases can cause this error.

## Resolution

1. Note the name mentioned in the error. 
1. Review the list of exported segments for all exports towards the export destination that show the error.
1. If you find the same segment selected in different exports, we recommend you change so each segment only is exported once.
1. Save changes to exports.
1. Next time when all exports run, your exports should not show that error.
