Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides device fingerprinting that (i) is based on artificial intelligence (AI); (ii) runs on Microsoft Azure; and (iii) is cloud-scalable, reliable, and has enterprise-grade security. Fraud Protection's device fingerprinting feature enables the identification of devices (computer, Xbox, tablet, and so on) across multiple sessions or interactions that engage with your business and other businesses in the Fraud Protection fraud network. Additionally, this feature allows Fraud Protection to link seemingly unrelated events to each other in the fraud network to identify patterns of fraud.
