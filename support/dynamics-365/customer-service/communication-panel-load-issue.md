# Communication panel doesn't load in Omnichannel for Customer Service app

## Symptom

The communication panel doesn't load in Omnichannel for Customer Service app.

## Cause

The panel doesn't load when:

- A record doesn't exist in the Channel Integration Framework app.
- Configurations don't sync.

## Resolution

- Create a Channel Integration Framework record with the following values. 

   | Field | value |
   |-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | Name | Omnichannel |
   | Label | Omnichannel |
   | Channel URL | \<Chat control cdn url>?uci=true&env=`<env>`&ocBaseUrl=\<oc endpoint\>&ucilib=\<crm org url\>/webresources/Widget/msdyn_ciLibrary.js |
   | Enable Outbound Communication | No |
   | Channel Order | 0 |
   | API Version | 1.0 |
   | Select Unified Interface Apps for the Channel | Omnichannel for Customer Service |
   | Select the Roles for the Channel | <li>Omnichannel administrator</li>  <li>Omnichannel agent</li> <li>Omnichannel supervisor</li> |

   To learn how to create a record, see [Configure a channel provider for your Dynamics 365 organization](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/channel-integration-framework/configure-channel-provider-channel-integration-framework).

- To sync the configurations, remove the channel and roles, add them again and save the record.

   3. Select the **Omnichannel** record from the list.
   4. Remove **Omnichannel for Customer Service** from the **Select Unified Interface Apps for the Channel** section.

   6. Remove **Omnichannel agent**, **Omnichannel supervisor**, and **Omnichannel administrator** from the **Select the Roles for the Channel** section.
   7. Add **Omnichannel agent**, **Omnichannel supervisor**, and **Omnichannel administrator** again in the **Select the Roles for the Channel** section.
   8. Select **Save** to save the record.
