# SLA KPI instance does not exist error when updating a Case

This article provides a resolution for the issue where case updating fails due to no SLAKPI instance exist.

## Symptoms

Error occur during case update when SLA KPI instance does not exist.

## Cause

This issue happens when active SLA is there, but no SLAItemâ€™s ChangeAttributeList is not defined or NULL.

## Resolution

- If SLA is having SLAItems then Admin can self resolve this issue by reactivating SLA which should calculate ChangeAttributeList again.
- If SLA is not having any SLAItem then Admin can self resolve this issue by defining SLAItems and reactivating the SLA again.
