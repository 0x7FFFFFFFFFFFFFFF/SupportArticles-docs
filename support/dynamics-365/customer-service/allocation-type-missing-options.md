# Unable to create entitlements because Allocation Type dropdown doesn't show any options

This article provides a solution for when you can't create entitlements because the Allocation Type dropdown doesn't show any options in Customer Service.

## Symptom

Unable to create entitlement forms from either the Customer Service Hub or the Customer Service admin center app because of lack of data in the entitlementâ€™s entity type mappings with the EntitlementEntityAllocationTypeMappingBase table.

## Scenario 1

### Cause
The **Allocation Type** field doesn't exist in the entitlement entity with **Case** option.

### Resolution

Add the **Allocation Type** field by performing the following steps:
1. In either of the apps, go to **Advanced Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System** > **Expand Entitlement Entity** > **Fields** > **Check Allocation Type** field options.
1. Add the **Allocation Type** field.

## Scenario 2

### Cause

The entitlement's entity allocation type mapping records aren't present in the EntitlementEntityAllocationTypeMappingBase table when the **Entity Type** field from the entitlement entity has more than one option other than case.

### Resolution

**Entity Type** is a type of option set field in the Entitlement table that has **Case** as the default option. If **Case** is the only option available for **Entity Type**, then the Entitlement table automatically loads **Allocation Type** values for the **Case** option. In a case where more than one option is set for the **Entity Type** field, you'll need to select the **Entity Type** option so that the Entitlement table will load **Allocation Type** values based on that **Entity Type** selection.

Add the entitlement's entity allocation type mapping records to the EntitlementEntityAllocationTypeMappingBase table.

- Use the following query to insert missing mapping records and add a record for allocation type for the **Case** entity type:

    `Insert INTO [dbo].[EntitlementEntityAllocationTypeMappingBase]` 
`(entitlemententityallocationtypemappingid, statecode, statuscode, allocationtype, entitytype, OwnerId) Values('0C537E5C-13E8-410B-A65C-783A113D49FC', 0, 1, 0, 0, 'F5C0B9AD-E076-ED11-81B3-6045BDE41C7D')`

- Include the following information for the mandatory fields:
    - **Entitlemententityallocationtypemappingid**: New GUID. 
    - **Statecode**: Provide state code that explains the status.
    - **Statuscode**: Provide the reason code that explains the status.
    - **Allocationtype**: Provide type of entitlement terms.
    - **Entitytype**: Entity type for which the entitlement applies.
    - **OwnerId**: Owner Id
