# How to fix runtime errors in Internet Explorer

[!INCLUDE [](../includes/browsers-important.md)]

A runtime error is a software or hardware problem that prevents Internet Explorer from working correctly. Runtime errors can be caused when a website uses HTML code that is not compatible with the web browser functionality.

## Which runtime error do you need to fix

The solution to runtime error messages in Internet Explorer is different depending on the type of runtime error that you receive.

Note that this article provides a resolution only for the following error message:

> Error  
> A Runtime Error has occurred.  
> Do you wish to Debug?  
> Line: line number  
> Error: nature of script error

## Resolution

Because this type of error message does not apply to you, you can prevent it from appearing. To do this, follow these steps in Internet Explorer:

1. Click the **Tools** button, and then click **Internet Options**. Or, press ALT+T, and then press O.

2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Advanced** tab.

3. Click to select the **Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)** and **Disable script debugging (Other)** check boxes, and then click to clear the **Display a notification about every script error** check box.

4. Click **OK** to close the **Internet Options** dialog box.

### Test the resolution

To see whether the problem is fixed, open or refresh the Web site that caused the error.

- If the Web site displays and works correctly, and if the runtime error message does not reappear, then you are finished. You may still receive a notification about the Web page error in the Internet Explorer status bar. However, you can just ignore the Web page error. If this computer has multiple users, you might also need to log on as another user and repeat these steps for other users.

- If the Web site still does not display or work correctly, the problem may be with the Web site itself. But to test this, either you must have access to another computer, or your computer must be set up for multiple users. If you have access to another computer, try to view the page from that other computer. If your computer is set up for multiple users, log on as another user, and then try to view the page again.

If the Web site still does not display or work correctly, then the problem is likely with the Web page itself. So you might want to contact the owner of the Web page to ask them to fix the problem.
