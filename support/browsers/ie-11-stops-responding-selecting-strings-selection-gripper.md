# Internet Explorer 11 stops responding when selecting strings with the selection gripper

[!INCLUDE [](../includes/browsers-important.md)]

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10

## Symptoms

On a touch-enabled device, you use the selection gripper by touching a text field on a webpage in Internet Explorer 11. When you move the selection gripper on the left side to overlap the gripper on the right side, Internet Explorer 11 stops responding.

For example, when you double-tap a string in a text field to select all of it, the issue occurs if you tap and hold the left selection gripper and move the gripper to the end of the string.

## Workaround

End the Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) process in the **Task Manager** and restart Windows.

## Status

Microsoft is currently investigating this problem. This article will be updated when a resolution is available.
