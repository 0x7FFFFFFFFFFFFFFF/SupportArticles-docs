# Getting ready for troubleshooting

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; .NET Core 2.1, .NET Core 3.1  

This article is structured to place more emphasis on the theory and principals to follow when starting to troubleshoot.

## Prerequisites

You should have following set up at the moment if you followed all the steps of this training so far:

- Nginx has two web sites:
      - The first web site listening for requests with the *myfirstwebsite* host header (`http://myfirstwebsite`) and routing the requests to the demo ASP.NET Core application, which is listening on port 5000.
      - The second web site listening for requests with host header *buggyamb* (`http://buggyamb`) and routing the requests to the second ASP.NET Core sample buggy application, which is listening on port 5001.
- Both ASP.NET Core applications should be running as services, which restart automatically when the server is rebooted or the applications stops or crashes.
- Linux local firewall is enabled and configured to allow SSH and HTTP traffic.

## Goal of this part

As you are preparing to troubleshoot potential issues you will run into with the configuration above, this part will help you consider the troubleshooting process as a whole.

## Is an everything in Linux a file?

You may heard the phrase "everything in Linux is file" before. Is this really the case? Although this article series does not focus on Linux expertise, the Linux operating system is heavily geared towards exposing everything through the file system. In the following paragraphs, we will try to delve deeper into why this is.

According to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs), Linux is based on a special file system called *procfs*.

The proc filesystem (procfs) is a special filesystem in [Unix-like](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems that presents information about [processes](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) and other system information in a hierarchical file-like structure, providing a more convenient and standardized method for dynamically accessing process data held in the kernel than traditional [tracing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)) methods or direct access to [kernel](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) memory. Typically, it is mapped to a [mount point](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing)#MOUNT-POINT) named */proc* at boot time. The proc file system acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel. It can be used to obtain information about the system and to change certain kernel parameters at runtime ([sysctl](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl)).

Hence, if you are a superuser on a Linux machine, you can access information about each of the executing processes through a file system file. If [everything in Linux is a file](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file), so is a process.

You may remember that we briefly discussed about this in previous parts of this series: a process is seen as a file under */proc/* directory. This directory is defined as a special directory [here](https://www.linux.com/news/discover-possibilities-proc-directory/):

*This special directory holds all the details about your Linux system, including its kernel, processes, and configuration parameters.*

If you examine this directory with the `ll /proc/` command you will see several "files" and "folders". For example you will see a "file" called `/proc/meminfo` which, if you run the cat `/proc/meminfo` command will yield detailed information about the server's memory usage statistics:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/meminfo.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb meminfo" border="true":::

Similarly, if you run the cat `/proc/cpuinfo` you will see server processor information:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/cpuinfo.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb cpuinfo" border="true":::

If you want to get Linux OS version information, you can use `cat /proc/version` commands:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/version.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb version" border="true":::

And so onâ€¦

## Is a process really a file?

Regarding the processes, each running process on your Linux system will be shown as a sub-directory under */proc/* folder and each folder is named as the process ID:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/proc.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb proc" border="true":::

If you examine one of the process ID directories, you will see some other files and folders. You need to prefix the command with "sudo" to get some of the information that is displayed below:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/sudo.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb sudo" border="true":::

Let's examine the `cmdline` for one of the processes. Run the `sudo cat /proc/19933/cmdline` command - the PID for the process you will choose will be different - and here is the output. This is the BuggyAmb application that was installed and configured in Chapter 2:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/cat.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb cat" border="true":::

Finally let's look at the environment variables for the BuggyAmb process by running the `sudo cat /proc/19933/environ` command. In a previous module, you were instructed to use the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable. This was created to instruct the web-application to listen on port 5001:

:::image type="content" source="./media/3-1-get-ready-troubleshooting/cat2.png" alt-text="BuggyAmb cat2" border="true":::

Using this technique, you can get much information about a process using this file system.

## The ps command

This article will not go into explaining this command, but it deserves to be mentioned here when talking about processes because it is one of the simplest ways to generate a snapshot of the current processes. I recommend you open the 'man' page with the `man ps` command and try it for yourself.

This should be enough guidance about how to get information about running processes on Linux. 

## Next steps

The next part will take a look at some important tools and commands that can be used when troubleshooting problems.
