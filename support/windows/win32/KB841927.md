# Don't use high-level languages, libraries, frameworks, virtual machines, or runtime in core operating system processes

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Windows  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 841927

## Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to only use C or C++ languages and Win32 APIs for any add-in components (that are loaded by core operating system (OS) processes) such as *lsass.exe*, *winlogon.exe*, and *logout.exe*.

The behavior of any high-level language, framework, or runtime in the components that are loaded by core operating system processes is undefined. For example, the Microsoft .NET Framework and the common language runtime weren't designed to run in the context of core operating system processes. Here is a partial list of high-level languages, frameworks, and runtimes where behavior is undefined in the context of core OS processes:
- .NET and .NET Framework
- .NET and .NET Framework languages
    - C#
    - Visual Basic
    - Managed Extensions for C++
- Java
- Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)
- Microsoft COM+
- Microsoft Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
- Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
- Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) framework

- [Security Support Providers (SSPs)](/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-providers-ssps-)
- [Custom authentication packages](/windows/win32/secauthn/authentication-packages)
- [Custom subauthentication packages](/windows/win32/secauthn/subauthentication-packages)
- [Local Security Authority (LSA) mode Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs), such as the Secure Channel (SChannel) CSP](/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptographic-service-providers)
