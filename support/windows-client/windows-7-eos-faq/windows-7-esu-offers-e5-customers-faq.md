## General information

**Is Windows 7 Year 1 ESU included with Microsoft 365 E5?**

Yes. Starting March 1, 2020, Microsoft is introducing a new program that includes Windows 7 Year 1 ESU together with Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 E5 Security, and Microsoft 365 Security + Compliance Subscription License.  

**In this new program, which subscriptions include Windows 7 Year 1 ESU?**

- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5 Security
- Microsoft 365 Security + Compliance Subscription License (SL)  

**Who can take advantage of this program?**

Windows 7 Year 1 ESU combined with Microsoft 365 E5 is available to Volume Licensing (VL) customers who purchase through EA or EAS agreements.  

**What are the effective dates of this program?**

March 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020.  

**Do customers have to maintain Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions throughout the ESU coverage period?**

Yes. Customers must maintain the qualifying E5 SKUs through the end of the Windows 7 Year 1 ESU period (January 12, 2021) to benefit from the included ESU.  

**Why is only Windows 7 Year 1 ESU included?**

We believe that most customers who have to purchase Windows 7 ESU require only Year 1 coverage as they continue to deploy Windows 10.
