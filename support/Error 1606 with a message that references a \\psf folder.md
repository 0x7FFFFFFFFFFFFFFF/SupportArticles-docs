# Error 1606 with a message that references a \\\psf folder

When you install Visual Studio on a Mac that’s running Parallels, this may trigger error 1606 and generate a message that references a \\\psf folder. To address this issue, go to http://kb.parallels.com/en/115026 (or the older http://kb.parallels.com/en/114310), and then reinstall the “Parallels Tools” integration piece that is specific to Macs that are running Parallels.
